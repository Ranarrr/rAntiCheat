# rRP ( rRecordPlayer ) / rSRP ( rStopRecordPlayer )
This is a function in the anticheat, which makes it possible to record every frame of a player.
This will output each frame in the format of, in a file in directory logs with filename of player.log:

( L DD/MM/YYYY - HH:mm:SS: sdmv(Sidemove): ### \t fwmv(Forwardmove): ### \t WASD \t DUCK \t JUMP \t Height_from_ground.00 \t Velocity.00 )

This can detect several things, like a bhop hack/macro, gstrafe hack/macro or an sgs hack/macro and etc.
